<h2><font color="blue">Exercise 2.4 - Create a Simple STAX Job and Run it</font></h2>
<p>
<h3>Objectives:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Learn how to create a simple STAX XML document that runs a non-STAF enabled
testcase and checks its return code to determine if it ran successfully and sends a message to the
STAX Monitor (and logs the message) which says whether the testcase ran successfully.
<li>Learn how to change how a testcase runs (without editing the XML document)
by passing different variables to it via the Script option.
</ol>
<p>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Note:  This exercise requires that you completed Part 1 Exercise 1.6 so that SimpleTestcase.class exists in
your C:\STAF\testcases directory (as well as .; has been added to the system CLASSPATH).
<p>
<li>Make a directory called xml in C:\STAF and change to this directory.  This directory (C:\STAF\xml) is where
you will put your xml files that define STAX jobs.
<p>
<li>Copy C:\STAFCD\Part2\exercise2.4\*.* to C:\STAF\xml as follows:
<pre>COPY C:\STAFCD\Part2\exercise2.4\*.* C:\STAF\xml\*.*</pre>
<li>Use an editor (e.g. write) to view file simple1.xml in directory C:\STAF\xml.
This STAX XML document demonstrates a simple STAX job that runs a Java testcase called SimpleTestcase on
the local machine.  It looks like the following:
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
&lt;!DOCTYPE stax SYSTEM "stax.dtd">

&lt;stax>

  &lt;defaultcall function="Main"/>

  &lt;script>numLoops = 10&lt;/script>

  &lt;function name="Main">

      &lt;sequence>
 
        &lt;process>
          &lt;location>'local'&lt;/location>
          &lt;command>'java'&lt;/command>
          &lt;parms>'SimpleTestcase %s' % numLoops&lt;/parms>
          &lt;env>'CLASSPATH={STAF/Env/Classpath};C:/STAF/testcases'&lt;/env>
       &lt;/process>

       &lt;if expr="RC == 0">
         &lt;sequence>
           &lt;message>'Completed %s loops' % numLoops&lt;/message>
           &lt;log>'Completed %s loops' % numLoops&lt;/log>
         &lt;/sequence>
         &lt;else>
           &lt;sequence>
             &lt;message>'Failed with RC=%s' % RC&lt;/message>
             &lt;log>'Completed %s loops' % numLoops&lt;/log>
           &lt;/sequence>
         &lt;/else>
       &lt;/if>

     &lt;/sequence>  

  &lt;/function>

&lt;/stax></pre>
<li>Save the file. 
<p>
<li>Start the STAX Monitor by typing:
<pre>java -jar c:/STAF/services/stax/STAXMon.jar</pre>
<li>Click on the "Submit New Job..." button.
<p>
<li>Enter the following information:
<pre>Job Name:  Simple Job
Filename:  C:\STAF\xml\simple1.xml</pre>
<li>Click on the "Test" button to verify that the XML document is valid.  You should get a "Validation Successful"
popup message.  If you don't, then you have a typo in the document.  The error message displayed should point you
to the line in error.  Edit the XML document and fix the problem and retest.
<p>
<li>Click on the "Submit New Job" button to start the job.
<p>
<li>While the job is running:
  <p>
  <ol type="a">
  <li>What is its Job ID? _______ 
  <br>Hint: It is a number displayed in the STAX Job Monitor panel's title. 
  <p>
  <li>You should notice that a new command prompt window has opened and it is executing SimpleTestcase
  (it loops for 10 seconds and displays a message every second).  When the testcase completes,
  this command prompt window closes.
  <p>
  <li>Note that in the "Active Job Elements" panel (in the Job Monitor window), you should see
  a process named Process1 running for 10 seconds.
  To the right of it, you should see its elapsed time is
  displayed (and continually updated).
  <p>
  Note that to the right of the elapsed time, you won't see any additional information
  (unless you changed the STAX Monitor Properties to select "Show Process &lt;No STAF
  Monitor information available> message</nobr>.  This is because the testcase itself
  that is running is not STAF enabled and thus, is not using the STAF Monitor service
  to log its current status.
  </ol>
<p>
<li>When the job completes:
  <p>
  <ol type="a">
  <li>Verify the "Messages" section displays "Completed 10 loops".
  <p> 
  <li>Verify the STAX Job <b>User</b> log contains a message with level
  "Info" and message text "Completed 10 loops" by selecting "Display"
  from the menu bar and then select "Display Job User Log".
  After verifying this, close the window displaying the Job User Log.
  </ol>
<p>
<li>Run the same STAX XML file again, this time changing the value of numLoops from 10 to 30.
Note that you can do this without editing the XML file by adding a Script option containing:
<pre>numLoops = 30</pre>
before submitting the job.
<p>
<b>Hint:</b>  From the "STAX Job Parameters ... panel, select the "Scripts" tab,
    click on "Add", type <tt>numLoops = 30</tt>, click on "Add", click on "Submit New Job".
<p>
<li>While the job is running:
  <p> 
  <ol type="a">
  <li>What is its Job ID? _______ 
  <br>Hint: It is a number displayed in the STAX Job Monitor panel's title. 
  <p>
  <li>You should notice that a new command prompt window has opened and is executing SimpleTestcase
  (it loops for 30 seconds and displays a message every second).  When the testcase completes,
  this command prompt window closes.
  </ol>
<p>
<li>When the job completes:
  <p>
  <ol type="a">
  <li>Verify the "Messages" section displays "Completed 30 loops".
  <p>
  <li>Verify the STAX Job <b>User</b> log contains a message with level
  "Info" and message text "Completed 30 loops" by selecting "Display"
  from the menu bar and then select "Display Job User Log".
  After verifying this, close the window displaying the Job User Log.

<h2><font color="blue">Exercise 2.5 - Create Another Simple STAX Job and Run it</font></h2>
<p>
<h3>Objectives:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Learn how to create a simple STAX XML document that runs a STAF enabled
testcase which updates its current status using the Monitor Service.
<li>Understand how the STAX Monitor displays the current status of a testcase when it uses the STAF Monitor service.
</ol>
<p>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Note:  This exercise requires that you completed Part 1 Exercise 1.7 so that STAFTestcase.class exists in
your C:\STAF\testcases directory (as well as .; has been added to the system CLASSPATH).
<p>
<li>Copy C:\STAF\xml\simple1.xml to C:\STAF\xml\simple2.xml as follows:
<pre>COPY C:\STAF\xml\simple1.xml C:\STAF\xml\simple2.xml</pre>
<li>Use an editor (e.g. write) to edit simple2.xml in directory C:\STAF\xml.
Change the value of the process's &lt;parms> element to contain:
<pre>'STAFTestcase %s' % numLoops</pre>
(replacing SimpleTestcase with STAFTestcase)
<p>
Now it will run a Java testcase called STAFTestcase on
the local machine.  This testcase uses the STAF Monitor service to update its current status
in the STAX Job Monitor while the testcase is running.
<p>
<li>Save the file. 
<p>
<li>Start the STAX Monitor by typing:
<pre>java -jar C:/STAF/services/stax/STAXMon.jar</pre>
<li>Click on the "Submit New Job..." button.
<p>
<li>Enter the following information:
<pre>Job Name:  Simple Job
Filename:  C:\STAF\xml\simple2.xml</pre>
<li>Click on the "Submit New Job" button to start the job.
<p>
<li>While the job is running:
  <p>
  <ol type="a">
  <li>What is its Job ID? _______ 
  <br>Hint: It is a number displayed in the STAX Job Monitor panel's title. 
  <p>
  <li>You should notice that it runs just like the sample1.xml job except for one thing.
  Note that in the "Active Job Elements" panel (in the Job Monitor window), you should see a monitor message
  that displays the current loop number (and is continually updated).

<h2><font color="blue">Exercise 2.7- Modify a STAX Job to Release Machines from a Resource Pool</font></h2>
<p>
<h3>Objectives:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Learn how to use imported functions.
<li>Learn how to iterate a Python list in STAX jobs.
<li>Learn how to use the Resource Pool service to allocate machines for use by a STAX job, run some tests, and
then release the machines so that they are available for other tests.
</ol>
<p>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
<p>
<li>Copy the xml files in directory C:\STAFCD\Part2\exercise2.7 to C:\STAF\xml as follows:
<pre>COPY C:\STAFCD\Part2\exercise2.7\*.xml C:\STAF\xml\*.xml</pre>
<li>Submit a STAX job using the STAX Monitor, specifying file C:\STAF\xml\respool.xml
<p>
<li>After the job successfully completes, look at the "Messages" panel.
It displays the results from querying the resource pool after 5 machines have been
allocated from it.  These results should look like:
<pre>
    5 of the 10 machines are available
    5 of the 10 machines are owned
</pre>
<p>
<li>Edit C:\STAF\xml\respool.xml by inserting code into function 'ReleaseMachines' to
release the machines that have been requested (allocated) from the resource pool,
that are in Python list variable machineList.
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>Find the following line in the C:\STAF\xml\respool.xml file and insert code after it.
  <pre>&lt;!-- Insert code here to release the machines that are in machineList --></pre>
  <li>Use the iterate element to iterate through the machineList.
  <p>Hint:  The syntax for the &lt;iterate> element you want to use here is:
  <pre>  &lt;iterate var="machine" in="machineList">

    &lt;sequence>

      &lt;!-- To be filled in by the next hints -->

    &lt;/sequence>

  &lt;/iterate></pre>
  <li>Call the 'RunSTAFCommand' function (a function imported from commonFunctions.xml) for
  each machine in machineList to specify a ResPool release request for that machine in the poolName pool.  
  <p>Hint: The AllocateMachines function in respool.xml calls the 'RunSTAFCommand' function to specify a
  ResPool request for an entry in the poolName pool so copy the following lines from it after the
  new &lt;iterate element's &lt;sequence> element.
  <pre>
  &lt;call function="'RunSTAFCommand'">
    [resPoolServer, 'RESPOOL', 'REQUEST POOL %s' % poolName]
  &lt;/call></pre>
  Modify the request (the third argument in the list) to release an entry from the resource pool.
  <p>Hint: Use the 'STAF local RESPOOL HELP' command to get the syntax for the RELEASE request:
  <pre>  'RELEASE POOL %s ENTRY %s FORCE' % (poolName, machine)</pre>
  <li>Call the 'CheckSuccess' function (a function imported from commonFunctions.xml) after
  calling the 'RunSTAFCommand' function to check whether it was successful (0 indicates it was).
  <p>Hint: The AllocateMachines function in respool.xml calls the 'CheckSuccess' function to check 
  for sucess, so copy the following lines from it:
  <pre>
  &lt;call function="'CheckSuccess'">
    [STAXResult[0], [0], STAXResult[1]]
  &lt;/call></pre>
  <li>So, the inserted code should look like:
  <pre>
  &lt;iterate var="machine" in="machineList">

    &lt;sequence>

      &lt;call function="'RunSTAFCommand'">
        [resPoolServer, 'RESPOOL',
         'RELEASE POOL %s ENTRY %s' % (poolName, machine)]
      &lt;/call>

      &lt;call function="'CheckSuccess'">
        [STAXResult[0], [0], STAXResult[1]]
      &lt;/call>
 
    &lt;/sequence>

  &lt;/iterate></pre>
  <li>Save the changes you made to the C:\STAF\xml\respool.xml file.
  </ul>
<p>
<li>Submit a STAX job using the STAX Monitor, specifying file C:\STAF\xml\respool.xml again.
<p>
<li>After the job successfully completes, look at the "Messages" panel.
The last query pool request should display the following results to show that
all 10 of the machines in the pool are available (now that you added the function to
release them).
<pre>
    10 of the 10 machines are available
    0 of the 10 machines are owned
</pre>
</ul>
</ol>
