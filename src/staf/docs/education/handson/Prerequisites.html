It is recommended that you run these exercises on a Windows 2000/XP machine.
At least 50MB of hard drive space is required for the exercises.
</font></li><br>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
It is recommended that you have network connectivity on the machine where you will
be running the exercises (only exercise 1.9 requires network connectivity).
</font></li><br>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
Install Java 1.4 SDK or later on the machine where you will be running the exercises.
Installing a JRE is *NOT* sufficient.  You must install an SDK so that the Java
compiler will be available.  Do not install Java to C:/Program Files/...  
Instead install it to a directory like c:/ibmsdk1.4.2.  To verify that you have
an SDK, must sure the "javac.exe" file exists in c:/ibmsdk1.4.2/bin
</font></li><br>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
Add the following to your machine's System PATH environment variable:
<pre>
c:\ibmsdk1.4.2\jre\bin;c:\ibmsdk1.4.2\bin
</pre>
</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
If you have User environment variables for PATH and/or CLASSPATH, ensure
that they have references to the System PATH/CLASSPATH:
<pre>
c:\abc\xyz;%PATH%
c:\abc\xyz;%CLASSPATH%
</pre>
</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
Create a directory on the machine where you will be running the exercises 
called "c:\STAFCD".  Download the education package to this directory and
unzip the file (by using PKZip or WinZip).  The education package can
be downloaded from:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/staf/STAF-STAX-HandsOn-Education-331.zip
</font></li><br>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
If you have a c:\winnt\system32\java.exe file, rename it or remove it for the class.
</font></li><br>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
Print a copy of the exercises 
(c:\STAFCD\Part1\Part1-Exercises.html)
(c:\STAFCD\Part2\Part2-Exercises.html)
(c:\STAFCD\Part3\Part3-Exercises.html)
(c:\STAFCD\Part4\Part4-Exercises.html)
and bring these printouts to the class.
</font></li><br>
<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
To view the presentations in PowerPoint format (.ppt), you will need Microsoft
PowerPoint.  To view the presentations in OpenDocument format (.odp), you will
need IBM Lotus Symphony, which can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/home.nsf/home">
IBM Lotus Symphony web site</a>, or another tool that supports the
OpenDocument format.
