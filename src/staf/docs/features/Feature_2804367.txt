Title       : Provide the ability to limit the result from FS GET FILE
              Provide the ability to limit the output buffer for a process

Description
-----------

Provide the ability to limit the results from STAF service requests that
return the contents of file(s), such as a FS GET FILE request or a
PROCESS START request that uses the RETURNSTDOUT/RETURNSTDERR/RETURNFILE
options because if the file being returned is very large (e.g. 50M), a
lot of memory will be used up (> 50M).  Many times, people should be
using other means to access the data in these files (e.g. reading text
files line by line instead of having the entire file contents in memory
at one time), or they may really only need the last nnn bytes of data in
the file (like you can get using the Unix tail function) or the first
nnn bytes of data in the file (like you can get using the Unix head
function).

Want to be able to have a STAF service, or an application set a limit
for all FS GET FILE requests and PROCESS START RETURNSTDOUT/
RETURNSTDERR/RETURNFILE requests that it submits.


Problem(s) Solved
-----------------

STAX is a good example of a STAF service that can be severely impacted
if a STAX job submits a FS GET FILE request or a PROCESS START request
that returns large files.  If if a STAX job consumes too much memory,
it can cause an OutOfMemory exception in STAF or STAX, or slow down the
performance significantly, impacting all STAX jobs that are running.
Many STAX service administrators would like to impose limits for these
STAF requests that can return too much data.

External Changes
----------------

a) New Operational Parameter

   Add the following new operational parameter for the STAF.cfg file:

   - MAXRETURNFILESIZE specifies the maximum size of a file that can
     be returned by a PROCESS START request or by a FS GET FILE request
     For the PROCESS service, this applies when using the RETURNSTDOUT,
     RETURNSTDERR, and/or RETURNFILE options on a PROCESS START request.
     For the FS service, this applies to the result from a FS GET FILE
     request.  The default is 0 which indicates not to limit the maximum
     size of returned files.

     The format of the value for each of these maxsize variables is:

       <MaxSize>[K | M]
   
     where <MaxSize> must be an integer >= 0.  Note that specifying 0
     indicates to not limit size of the data returned.
     - If <MaxSize> is not followed by "K" or "M" (case-insensitive),
       then it specifies the maximum number of characters in the file
       to be returned.
     - If <MaxSize> is followed by "K" (case-insensitive), then it
       specifies the maximum number of characters in kilobytes in the
       file to be returned.
     - If <MaxSize> is followed by "M" (case-insensitive), then it
       specifies the maximum number of characters in megabytes in the
       file to be returned.

b) Add a new STAF return code, 58, to indicate the maximum size
   was exceeded.

   C:\>STAF local HELP ERROR 58
   Response
   --------
   Description: Maximum Size Exceeded
   Details    : This indicates that the size of a file exceeded the
   maximum size allowed (e.g. per the MAXRETURNFILESIZE operational
   parameter or per the MAXRETURNFILESIZE setting for the STAX
   service). A maximum file size is usually set to prevent the
   creation of result strings that require more memory than is
   available which can cause errors or crashes.

   Note: Additional information specifying why this error occurred
   may be provided in the result passed back from the submit call.

c) Changes to the FS GET FILE request:

   The FS GET FILE request will check if the MAXRETURNFILESIZE
   operational parameter is set in its STAF.cfg file.  And, it
   will check if a STAF/MaxReturnFileSize handle variable is set
   in the handle variable pool by the machine that submitted the
   request.  It will choose the lowest non-zero value specified
   for the maximum size and use it to determine the maximum number
   of bytes that can be returned in the specified file.
   If neither is specified, there is no size limit.

   Results:

   If the size of a returned file exceeds the maximum allowed size,
   the return code is set to 58 (Maximum Size Exceeded).


d) Changes to the PROCESS START request:

   The PROCESS START request will check if one or more of the
   RETURNSTDOUT, RETURNSTDERR, and/or RETURNFILE options were
   specified in the request.  If so, it will check if the
   MAXRETURNFILESIZE operational parameter is set in its STAF.cfg
   file.  And, it will check if a STAF/MaxReturnFileSize handle
   variable is set in the handle variable pool by the machine
   that submitted the request.  It will choose the lowest
   non-zero value specified for the maximum size and use it to
   determine the maximum number of bytes that can be returned
   in the file(s).  If neither is specified, there is no size
   limit.

   Results:

   If the size of a returned file exceeds the maximum allowed
   size, the return code for the returned file in the 'fileList'
   is set to 58 (Maximum Size Exceeded).

e) New STAX Service Parameter

   Add the following optional parameter when registering the STAX
   service:

   - MAXRETURNFILESIZE: specifies the maximum size of a file that
     can be returned by a <stafcmd> element that submits a
     "GET FILE" request to the FS service, as well as the maximum
     size of files that can be returned by a <process> element that
     uses the <returnstdout>, <returnstderr>, and/or <returnfile>
     sub-elements.  Its format is the same as described for the
     MAXRETURNFILESIZE operational parameter.  

     If the STAX service sets the MAXRETURNFILESIZE setting, it
     will be provided to the machines where <stafcmd> and <process>
     elements are run.  To do this, for each handle the STAX
     service creates (e.g. for each STAX job), it would automatically
     set a STAF/MaxReturnFileSize handle variable to the value
     specified by the MAXRETURNFILESIZE setting.  STAF's FS and
     PROCESS services will be changed to check if this handle
     variable has been set and use whichever is smaller -- the
     maximum size as set via the handle variable, or the
     MAXRETURNFILESIZE operational parameter if set in the STAF.cfg
     file on the FS/PROCESS service machine.

     A STAX administrator may want to restrict the maximum size
     of these returned files to help prevent a STAX job from
     causing reduced performance because of the memory consumed
     and/or an OutOfMemory errors.

     While using a handle variable doesn't prevent a STAX job from
     resetting this variable to another maximum size within a STAX
     job, it should prevent most accidental egregious errors.

   Example:

   service STAX library JSTAF execute C:/STAF/services/stax/stax.jar \
                OPTION JVMName=STAX PARMS "MAXRETURNFILESIZE 10M"

f) Add the ability to dynamically set the MAXRETURNFILESIZE setting
   for the STAX service by updating the SET request for the STAX
   service as follows:

     SET MAXRETURNFILESIZE <MaxSize>

   Example:

     STAF local STAX SET MAXRETURNFILESIZE 15M

g) Update the LIST SETTINGS request for the STAX service to list
   the MAXRETURNFILESIZE setting by adding the following new key
   to the map class:

   Key Name          Display Name         Type     Format / Value
   ----------------- -------------------- -------- -----------------
   maxReturnFileSize Max Return File Size <String>

   Note:  The "Max Return File Size" is the maximum number of bytes
   that can be returned in a file when a <stafcmd> element submits a
   "FS GET FILE" request or when a <process> uses the <returnstdout>,
   <returnstderr>, and/or <returnfile> sub-elements.

   Example:

   C:\>STAF local STAX LIST SETTINGS
   Response
   --------
   {
      Event Machine         : local
      Event Service Name    : Event
      Number of Threads     : 5
      Process Timeout       : 60000

      Max File Cache Size   : 20
      Max Machine Cache Size: 20
      Max Return File Size  : 10485760

Design Considerations
---------------------

1) If the "typed variables" (e.g. read-only) feature and/or
the "detecting that a handle is a service's handle" feature
were implemented, a lot of other options would open up.


Backward Compatibility Issues
-----------------------------

1) Only machines that are running a version of STAF that provides
these features will actually heed the maximum limits, of course.
So, a STAX job may want to verify that the remote machines it is
submitting FS GET FILE requests and PROCESS START RETURNSTDOUT/
RETURNSTDERR/RETURNFILE requests to are running the latest
version of STAF.
