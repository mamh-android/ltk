   = Internal changes
   * Changes required to migrate from one release to another

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.5.0 Beta 1: 12/02/2010

  + Changed the default signal handler for the STAXEmptyList signal to do
    nothing so it no longer logs an error in the job log (Feature #3083827)
  + Changed the result from EXECUTE WAIT RETURNRESULT and GET RESULT requests
    to include a list of errors, if any, in the job log (Feature #3082388)
  + Added the ability to import all .xml files from a directory via the import
    element (Feature #3076665)
  + Added the ability to list jobs that are in the process of being submitted
    for execution (that are in a "Pending" state) by assigning a job ID before
    the xml file is parsed (Feature #3032420)
  + Changed the STAX Monitor to display a "Please wait" message while a job is
    being submitted for execution and to display and manipulate jobs in the
    "Active Jobs" list that are in a "Pending" state (Feature #3105346)
  - Fixed an import error if a relative file name is specified and its parent
    file name ends in a file separator (Bug #3111992)
  + Changed to use Jython 2.5.2 instead of Jython 2.1 which provides new
    Python functionality that you can use within STAX jobs (Feature #18678258)
    Notes:
    1) Jython 2.5.2 requires Java 1.5 or later so STAX now requires Java 1.5
       or later.
    2) Since the final version of Jython 2.5.2 has not yet been released and
       because we don't have approval to distribute it, you must download and
       install Jython 2.5.2 RC 2 from http://www.jython.org and use the
       provided STAXJarUpdateForJython252 Java application to embed Jython
       2.5.2 into the STAX.jar file to use when registering the STAX service.
       For more info on this, see the STAX User's Guide or the readme.1st file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.4.2: 05/10/2010

  - Changed the STAX service to automatically increase the maximum record size
    for the local LOG service to 1M to decrease the possibility that a message
    logged to the STAX job and job user logs will be truncated (Bug #2980829)

    (Bug #2692644)
  - Fixed a problem where the STAX file cache wasn't being cleaned up if the
    maxFileCacheSize was dynamically set to 0 (Bug #2703685)
  + Changed the import element so that the machine attribute is no longer
    required (defaults to the machine where the current xml file resides) and
    added the ability to specify a relative file path for the file attribute,
    relative to the current xml file's parent directory (Feature #2417461)
  + Changed the STAX service and monitor to automatically increase the maximum
    queue size for handles to 1000 for the service and 10000 for the monitor,
    so no longer have to SET MAXQUEUESIZE in STAF.cfg (Feature #2703813)
  + Changed the STAX Monitor to use the ALL option when submitting a GET WAIT
    request to the QUEUE service to improve performance.  The STAX Monitor now
    requires STAF V3.3.3 or later (Feature #2616498)

    testcase information, without having to parse the STAX Job Log by adding a
    GET RESULT [DETAILS] request and by adding testcase info to the result
    from an EXECUTE WAIT RETURNRESULT [DETAILS] request and to the STAX job
    end notification message (Feature #2505719)
  - Fixed a problem where a STAX EXECUTE WAIT request may never complete or

    is specified in years using the 'y' suffix (Bug #2183070)
  - Fixed a job hang problem if specify a blank timer duration (Bug #2207697)
  + Added support for more time representations (e.g. seconds, minutes, hours,
    days, weeks) for the WAIT option on an EXECUTE request.  This change means
    that the STAX service now requires STAF V3.3.2 or later (Feature #2182713)
  - Fixed a NullPointerException in the STAX Monitor in STAXMonitorFrame.
    handleCommand() that could occur monitoring an existing job (Bug #2226865)

    version is not running (Bug #2383550)
  + Added the ability to save STAX logs as text or html files via the STAX
    Monitor Log Viewer.  This change means that the STAX Monitor now requires
    STAF V3.3.2 or later as it is dependent on changes made to the
    STAFLogViewer which is part of STAF Java support (Feature #2278018)
  - Fixed a problem where STAXMonitorSubjobExtension wasn't calling the
    STAFLogViewer passing it the selected font name (Bug #2406885)

Version 1.0 Beta 2: 06/28/2001

  - Fixed bug some events got "lost" because STAF got bogged down with all the
    events generates by STAX.  Fixed by changing to use ReqSync instead of 
    ReqFireAndForget when generating events.
