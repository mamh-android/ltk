<h1><b><a name="Header_Overview" href="#ToC_Overview">Overview</a></b></h1>

The Cron service allows you to register STAF commands that will be executed
at a specified time interval(s).  The Cron service also provides a User Interface
to simplify interaction with the Cron service
<p>
Note that Cron registration information is persistent data. This means
that if you register with the Cron Service, if you shutdown STAF and restart
it (even if you reboot the machine), the prior registration information
will still be active. When STAF starts, it reads in the previous Cron registration
information, and will execute the registered STAF commands at the specified
time interval(s).
<p>
Note that the Cron service uses its machine's Operating System date/time
information to determine the current date/time in relation to the registered
requests.&nbsp; Users of the Cron service must ensure that the machine
on which the Cron service is running has the correct Operating System date/time
(and that it correctly updates the current date/time relative to Daylight
Savings Time).
<p>

<h1><b><a name="Header_Installation" href="#ToC_Installation">Installation and Configuration</a></b></h1>

<ol>
<li>Install Java 1.5 (aka 5.0) or later.
<p>
<li>Install STAF Version 3.3.3 or later by following the
installation instructions in the STAF documentation.
<p>
<li>Install the Cron service by downloading the CronV340.zip/tar
file from <a href="http://staf.sourceforge.net/getservices.php">Get STAF Services</a>
into a local directory (e.g. C:/STAF/services or /usr/local/staf/services) and extracting it.
<p>
<li>Configure the Cron service by adding the following statement to
your STAF configuration file:
<pre>
SERVICE &lt;Name> LIBRARY JSTAF EXECUTE &lt;Cron Jar File Name>
               [OPTION &lt;Name[=Value]>]... 
               [PARMS OLDVARRESOLUTION]
</pre>
<p>where:
<ul>
<li><tt>SERVICE</tt> specifies the name by which the Cron service will be known on this machine.</li>
<p>
<li><tt>EXECUTE</tt> specifies the fully qualified name of the STAFCron.jar file.
On Windows systems, this might be <tt>C:/STAF/services/cron/STAFCron.jar</tt>.
On Unix systems, this might be <tt>/usr/local/staf/services/cron/STAFCron.jar</tt>.
This option will resolve STAF variables, so you could use the <tt>STAF/Config/STAFRoot</tt>
variable to specify the jar file name in a platform independent manner such as
<tt>{STAF/Config/STAFRoot}/services/cron/STAFCron.jar</tt>.</li>
<p>
<li><tt>OPTION</tt> specifes a configuration option that will be passed on to the
JSTAF Java service proxy library.  This is typically used by service proxy libraries
to further control the interface to the actual service implementation.
You may specify multiple <tt>OPTIONs</tt> for a given service.  See the STAF User's Guide
for more information on options for the JSTAF Java service proxy library.</li>
<p>
<li><tt>OLDVARRESOLUTION</tt> specifies to perform the old way of variable resolution
(e.g. the way variables resolution was done prior to Cron V3.3.1).
This means that on a <tt>REGISTER</tt> request, options <tt>MACHINE</tt>,
<tt>SERVICE</tt>, and <tt>REQUEST</tt> will resolve STAF variables when the
<tt>REGISTER</tt> request is submitted (which means the variables are resolved on the
Cron service machine).  Note that in Cron V3.3.1, these options were
changed to not resolve STAF variables at the time when a <tt>REGISTER</tt> request is
submitted so that STAF variables will be resolved when the STAF service request is
submitted.</li>
</ul>    
<p>
<b>Examples:</b>
<p>
<tt>SERVICE Cron LIBRARY JSTAF EXECUTE {STAF/Config/STAFRoot}/services/cron/STAFCron.jar</tt>
<p>
<tt>SERVICE Cron LIBRARY JSTAF EXECUTE {STAF/Config/STAFRoot}/services/cron/STAFCron.jar \</tt>

<h4>Results</h4>

Upon successful return, the result buffer contains the Cron ID.

<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Goal:</b> Execute the command "start command notepad" at 1:00AM every day.
<p><b>Syntax:</b>&nbsp; <tt>
STAF local CRON REGISTER MACHINE local SERVICE PROCESS REQUEST "START COMMAND notepad" HOUR 1</tt>
<p>
<li><b>Goal:</b> Execute the command "start command notepad" at 1:00AM every Sunday.
<p><b>Syntax:</b>&nbsp; <tt>
STAF local CRON REGISTER MACHINE local SERVICE PROCESS REQUEST "START COMMAND notepad" HOUR 1 WEEKDAY Sunday</tt>
<p>
<li><b>Goal:</b> Execute a STAX job every December 1st.
<p><b>Syntax:</b>&nbsp;
<tt>
STAF local CRON REGISTER MACHINE local SERVICE stax REQUEST "EXECUTE FILE c:/tests/startall.xml" MONTH 12 DESCRIPTION "Kick off all of the regression tests"</tt>
<p>
Note that the registration in this example would only result in the command
being executed the next time the month changes to 12.  So, if you
registered this command on Dec 5, 2003, it would not be executed until
12AM Dec 1 2004.
<p>
<li><b>Goal:</b> Execute a STAX job every day in December.
<p><b>Syntax:</b>&nbsp;
<tt>
STAF local CRON REGISTER MACHINE local SERVICE stax REQUEST "EXECUTE FILE c:/tests/startall.xml" MONTH 12 DAY "*"</tt>
<p>
<li><b>Goal:</b> Execute a STAX job in file C:/automate/updateStatus.xml via
     the STAX service on machine server1 every week day (Monday through Friday) at the following times:  8:00AM, 12:00PM,
    3:00PM, 4:00PM, 5:00PM, and midnight.
<p><b>Syntax:</b>&nbsp;
<tt>STAF local CRON REGISTER MACHINE server1 SERVICE stax REQUEST "EXECUTE FILE c:/automate/updateStatus.xml" WEEKDAY "Monday-Friday" HOUR "8, 12, 15-18, 0"</tt>
<p>
<li><b>Goal:</b> Execute a STAX job in file /tests/TestA.xml' via the STAX service on machine server1
     every day at midnight.  This STAX job takes the following map of arguments as input:
     <tt>{'machine': 'client1', 'testDir': '/tests'}</tt>
    <p><b>Syntax:</b>&nbsp;
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li>This example uses the <tt>REQUEST</tt> option which will resolves STAF variables.
      A STAF variable reference is denoted by surrounding the variable in curly braces, e.g. {MyVar}.
      It is important to understand this because the value being specified for REQUEST
      contains a "{".  So, because of this special significance of "{", if you do not
      want variable substitution performed, use a caret, "^", as an escape character for "{" and "^".
      This is talked about in section
      <a href="http://staf.sourceforge.net/current/STAFUG.htm#varResolve">8.19.5 RESOLVE</a>
      in the STAF User's Guide when discussing the VAR service.
      If you forget to escape the { used to denote the beginning of a map (aka dictionary)
      in Python, this request will fail with RC 13 (Variable Does Not Exist) and
      with an error message that says "Variable resolution failed" for the REQUEST value.
      <p>
      <tt>STAF local CRON REGISTER MACHINE server1 SERVICE STAX REQUEST
        "EXECUTE FILE /tests/TestA.xml ARGS \"^{'machine': 'client1', 'testDir': '/tests'}\"" HOUR 0</tt>
      <p>
      On Windows, we need to also escape the "^" with another "^" if submitted from the Windows
      command prompt (cmd.exe) because cmd.exe eats one of the carets when enclosed in double quotes:
      <p>
      <tt>STAF local CRON REGISTER MACHINE server1 SERVICE STAX REQUEST
        "EXECUTE FILE /tests/TestA.xml ARGS \"^^{'machine': 'client1', 'testDir': '/tests'}\"" HOUR 0</tt>
  <p>
  <li>This example uses the <tt>PYTHONREQUEST</tt> option which does not resolve STAF variables.
      It specifies the request using Python syntax.  Because the PYTHONREQUEST value is enclosed
      in double quotes and single quotes, any quotes used within this value need to be escaped with a backslash.
    <p>
    <tt>STAF local CRON REGISTER MACHINE server1 SERVICE STAX PYTHONREQUEST
        "'EXECUTE FILE /tests/TestA.xml ARGS \"{\'machine\': \'client1\', \'testDir\': \'/tests\'}\"'" HOUR 0</tt>
  <p>
  <li>This example uses the <tt>PREPARE</tt> option in addition to the <tt>PYTHONREQUEST</tt> option to help construct
      the request in Python. 
    <p>
    <tt>STAF local CRON REGISTER MACHINE server1 SERVICE STAX PYTHONREQUEST
        "'EXECUTE FILE /tests/TestA.xml ARGS \"%s\"' % (args)"
        PREPARE "args = {'machine': 'client1', 'testDir': '/tests'}" HOUR 0</tt>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Actually, it's usually easier to register a more complex request like this that uses Python code
  via the CronUI instead of the command line because then you don't have to bother so much with
  escaping quotes.
  See the <a href="#Header_UIRegExample">Registration Example using Python and Prepare Script</a>
  section for an example of how to register this STAF command via the Cron User Interface.
</ul>

<h2><b><a name="Header_Unregister" href="#ToC_Unregister">UNREGISTER</a></b></h2>

UNREGISTER unregisters a STAF command with the Cron Service.

<h4>Syntax</h4>

<tt>UNREGISTER ID &lt;registrationID></tt>
<p><tt>ID</tt> specifies

<h2><b><a name="Header_Trigger" href="#ToC_Trigger">TRIGGER</a></b></h2>

TRIGGER submits a registered STAF command.  It is useful for testing the STAF
command at any given time (without matching the registered time triggers).

<h4>Syntax</h4>

<tt>TRIGGER ID &lt;registrationID> [SCRIPT <Python code>]...</tt>
<p>
<tt>ID</tt> specifies
the Cron ID which is to be triggered.
<p>
<tt>SCRIPT</tt> defines Python code to be executed.  You may specify any
number of SCRIPT options.  They will be executed in the order specified, and
will be executed prior to the registration's PREPARE, PYTHONMACHINE,
PYTHONSERVICE, AND PYTHONREQUEST values are evaluated.

<h4>Security</h4>

This request requires trust level 5.

<h4>Results</h4>

If the STAF command was successfully submitted, the return code will be zero.
This does not mean that the STAF command was successful, however; it only
indicates that the STAF command was successfully submitted.  You will need to
check the Cron service log to determine the RC and result that the STAF command
returned.
<p>
Upon successful return:
<ul>
<li>The result buffer for a <tt>TRIGGER</tt> request will contain
a marshalled <tt>&lt;Map:STAF/Service/Cron/Trigger></tt> which
represents the information about the submitted STAF command.
The map is defined as follows:
<p>

<h1><b><a name="Persistent_Registration_Data" href="#ToC_Persistent">Persistent Registration Data</a></b></h1>
<p>
Note that Cron registration information is persistent data. This means
that if you register with the Cron Service, if you shutdown STAF and restart
it (even if you reboot the machine), the prior registration information
will still be active. When STAF starts, it reads in the previous Cron registration
information, and will execute the registered STAF commands at the specified
time interval(s).
<p>In Cron V3.2.0, the format of this data was modified.  Persistent
registration data for versions prior to Cron V3.2.0 will automatically be
migrated to the new format.  Note that the new format can not be used
with versions of Cron prior to V3.2.0.

<p>

<h1><b><a name="Header_Logging" href="#ToC_Logging">Service Logging</a></b></h1>
<p>
The Cron service maintains a machine log where it writes information about the
STAF commands that it has submitted. It is important to check the log to
determine the results of STAF commands submitted by the Cron service.
The Cron service will log an entry when the following occurs:
<ul>
<li>A REGISTER request is received.  This log entry will begin with
<pre>[ID=&lt;xx>] [&lt;machine>, &lt;handleName>]</pre>where <tt>&lt;xx></tt> is the ID that was
registered, <tt>&lt;machine></tt> is the machine that originated the REGISTER request, and
<tt>&lt;handleName></tt> is the name of the handle that originated the REGISTER request.
The level of the log entry will be <tt>Info</tt>.
<br><br>
<li>A time trigger matches the options previously specified in a REGISTER request,
and the STAF command has been submitted.  This log entry will begin with
<pre>[ID=&lt;xx>] [&lt;machine>:&lt;requestNumber>]</pre>where <tt>&lt;xx></tt> is the ID for which the STAF command
was submitted, <tt>&lt;machine></tt> is the machine on which the STAF command was submitted,
and <tt>&lt;requestNumber></tt> is the request number for the STAF command.
The level of the log entry will be <tt>Info</tt>.
<br><br>
<li>A time trigger matches the options previously specified in a REGISTER request,
but a Python error was encountered when evaluating the registration options.  This log entry will begin with
<pre>[ID=&lt;xx>] Python error</pre>where <tt>&lt;xx></tt> is the ID for which the Python interpreter
encountered an error.
The level of the log entry will be <tt>Error</tt>.
<br><br>
<li>A time trigger matches the options previously specified in a REGISTER request,
but an error was encountered when submitting the STAF command.  This log entry will begin with
<pre>[ID=&lt;xx>] Error submitting a STAF command.</pre>
where <tt>&lt;xx></tt> is the registration ID of the STAF command that was submitted.
The level of the log entry will be <tt>Error</tt>.
<br><br>
<li>A time trigger matches the options previously specified in a REGISTER request,
but the ID is disabled.  This log entry will begin with
<pre>[ID=&lt;xx>] ID is disabled. STAF command not submitted.
</pre>where <tt>&lt;xx></tt> is the ID for which the time trigger matched.
The level of the log entry will be <tt>Info</tt>..
<br><br>
<li>The service receives notification that a submitted STAF command has completed.
This log entry will begin with
<pre>[ID=&lt;xx>] [&lt;machine>:&lt;requestNumber>]</pre>where <tt>&lt;xx></tt> is the ID for which the STAF command
was executed, <tt>&lt;machine></tt> is the machine on which the STAF command was executed,
and <tt>&lt;requestNumber></tt> is the request number for the STAF command.  The log
entry will include the RC and Result from the STAF command.
If the RC is 0, the level of the log entry will be <tt>Pass</tt>; otherwise
the level of the log entry will be <tt>Fail</tt>.
<br><br>
<li>The service receives notification that an asynchronous PROCESS START command
has completed.  This log entry will begin with
<pre>[ID=&lt;xx>] [&lt;machine>:&lt;requestNumber>]</pre>where <tt>&lt;xx></tt> is the ID for which the STAF command
was executed, <tt>&lt;machine></tt> is the machine on which the STAF command was executed,
and <tt>&lt;requestNumber></tt> is the request number for the STAF command.  The log
entry will include the RC and Result from the STAF process.
If the RC is 0, the level of the log entry will be <tt>Pass</tt>; otherwise
the level of the log entry will be <tt>Fail</tt>.
<br><br>
<li>An UNREGISTER request is received.  This log entry will begin with
<pre>[ID=&lt;xx>] [&lt;machine>, &lt;handleName>]</pre>where <tt>&lt;xx></tt> is the ID that was
unregistered, <tt>&lt;machine></tt> is the machine that originated the UNREGISTER request, and
<tt>&lt;handleName></tt> is the name of the handle that originated the UNREGISTER request.
The level of the log entry will be <tt>Info</tt>.
<br><br>
<li>An ENABLE request is received.  This log entry will begin with
<pre>[ID=&lt;xx>] [&lt;machine>, &lt;handleName>]</pre>where <tt>&lt;xx></tt> is the ID that was
enabled, <tt>&lt;machine></tt> is the machine that originated the ENABLE request, and
<tt>&lt;handleName></tt> is the name of the handle that originated the ENABLE request.
The level of the log entry will be <tt>Info</tt>.
<br><br>
<li>A DISABLE request is received.  This log entry will begin with
<pre>[ID=&lt;xx>] [&lt;machine>, &lt;handleName>]</pre>where <tt>&lt;xx></tt> is the ID that was
disabled, <tt>&lt;machine></tt> is the machine that originated the DISABLE request, and
<tt>&lt;handleName></tt> is the name of the handle that originated the DISABLE request.
The level of the log entry will be <tt>Info</tt>.
</ul>
<p>
The <tt>[ID=&lt;xx>]</tt> and <tt>[ID=&lt;xx>] [&lt;machine>:&lt;requestNumber>]</tt> tags in
the log entries can be useful when querying the log.  They can be used with
the CONTAINS option of the log service's QUERY request.
<p>
The logname for the Cron service is the name under which the service is
registered.
<p>
Here is an example of what a Cron service log on the local machine 
could look like (shown via a request from the command line
in the table format):
<pre>
C:\>STAF local log QUERY MACHINE {STAF/Config/MachineNickname} LOGNAME cron

<h1><a name="PythonVars" href="#ToC_PythonVars"><b>Using Python</b></a></h1>
<p>
The Cron service lets uses the Python scripting language for variable and
expression evaluation for the following REGISTER and TRIGGER request options:
<ul>  
    <li>PYTHONMACHINE</li>
    <li>PYTHONSERVICE</li>
    <li>PYTHONREQUEST</li>
    <li>PREPARE</li>
    <li>SCRIPT</li>
</ul>
<p>
This allows the Cron service to take advantage of the powerful and
easy-to-use features of Python.  The Cron service uses Jython 2.5.2 to
execute Python code.  Jython is a version of Python written entirely in
Java that runs under any compliant Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
<p>
Python variable names must follow the Python variable naming conventions.
In Python, variable names come into existence when you assign values to them,
but there are a few rules to follow when picking names for variables.
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Syntax: (underscore or letter) + (any number of letters, digits or underscores)</i></li>
  <ul>
      Variable names must start with an underscore or letter, and be followed
      by any number of letters, digits, or underscores. _machine, machine, and
      Mach_1 are legal names, but 1_Mach, mach$, and @#! are not.
  </ul>
<p>
<li><i>Case matters: MACHNAME is not the same as machname</i></li>
  <ul>
      Python always pays attention to case, both in names you create and in
      reserved words. For instance, X and x refer to two different variable names.
  </ul>
<p>
<li><i>Python reserved words are off limits</i></li>
  <ul>
      You cannot define variable names to be the same as words that mean
      special things in the Python language. Following are reserved words in
      Python: and, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except,
      exec, finally, for, from global, if, import, in, is, lambda, not, or, pass,
      print, raise, return, try, while.
      <p>
      <b>Note:</b>  Python lets you use the names of Python built-in functions as
      variable names.  However, we recommend that you don't use the name of a
      Python built-in function as a variable name because you may want to use the
      Python built-in function at some point when triggering your registration.
      Following are names of Python built-in functions:  abs, basestring, bool,
      callable, chr, classmethod, cmp, compile, complex, delattr, dict, dir,
      divmod, enumerate, eval, execfile, file, filter, float, getattr, globals,
      hasattr, hash, help, hex, id, input, int, isinstance, issubclass, iter,
      len, locals, long, map, max, min, object, oct, open, ord, pow, property,
      range, raw_input, reduce, reload, repr, round, setattr, slice, staticmethod,
      str, sum, super, tuple, type, unichr, unicode, vars, xrange, zip.
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Python string constants can be enclosed in single or double quotes, which
allows embedded quotes of the opposite flavor.
<p>
For example, the following two lines of Python code do exactly the same thing.
They assign a string constant (literal) "CoolTest" to the value of a variable
named testName.
<pre>
testName = "CoolTest1"
testName = 'CoolTest1'
</pre>
However, the following line is not the same.  It assigns the value
of a variable named CoolTest1 to the value of a variable named
testName.  If this was not what you intended and a variable named
CoolTest1 does not exist, a PythonException will be raised and logged
in the service log.
<pre>
testName = CoolTest1
</pre>
<p>
Say, you wanted to use a Python variable named machName in a STAF service
request string.  Your Python code could look like:
<pre>
request = 'RELEASE POOL MachinePool ENTRY %s' % (machName)
</pre>
where the %s indicates a String format (and can also be used for decimal
format, etc.), and where the value of the machName variable would replace
the %s marker.
<p>
So, if the value of variable machName is 'client1.company.com', after being
evaluated by Python, the request variable's value would be:
<pre>
'RELEASE POOL MachinePool ENTRY client1.company.com'
</pre>
<p>
Here are a couple of examples of how you might use Python code in the
PREPARE and PYTHONREQUEST options when submitting a REGISTER request
to the Cron service:
<ul>
<li>This example registers a STAF command that submits a RELEASE request
    to the ResPool service to release entry client1.company.com from
    resource pool MachinePool every night at 10:00pm.  It sets Python
    variable <b>machName</b> to 'client1.company.com' using Python code
    in the PREPARE option.  In the PYTHONREQUEST option, it uses Python
    code to construct the request to release the entry specified by Python
    variable <b>machName</b> from the MachinePool.
    <p>
    <tt>STAF local CRON REGISTER MACHINE server1 SERVICE ResPool 
        PYTHONREQUEST "'RELEASE POOL MachinePool ENTRY %s' % (machName)" 
        PREPARE "machName = 'client1.company.com'" HOUR 22</tt></li>
<p>
<li>This example registers a STAF command that submits a START request
    to the PROCESS service at midnight every Saturday to run command
    C:/MyApp/myApp.exe passing it the registration ID of this cron job
    as a parameter.  In the PREPARE option, it imports the
    com.ibm.staf.STAFUtil Java class so it can use its wrapData() method
    to "wrap" the value for the COMMAND option since it contains a space.
    It also constructs the command to run (e.g. 'C:/MyApp/myApp.exe 1'
    if its registration ID is 1) passing Python variable STAFCronID as
    a parameter to myApp.exe.  Note that STAFCronID is set by the Cron
    service to the registration ID of the request being triggered.
    <p>
    <tt>STAF local CRON REGISTER MACHINE local SERVICE PROCESS PYTHONREQUEST 
        "'START SHELL COMMAND %s RETURNSTDOUT STDERRTOSTDOUT' % (STAFUtil.wrapData(command))" 
        PREPARE "from com.ibm.staf import STAFUtil; command = 'C:/MyApp/myApp.exe %s' % (STAFCronID)" 
        WEEKDAY Saturday HOUR 0</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>
Actually, it's usually easier to register more complex requests like these
that use Python code via the Cron User Interface (CronUI) instead of the
command line because then you don't have to bother so much with escaping
quotes and you can have multiple lines of Python code.  See the
<a href="#Header_UIRegExample">Registration Example using Python and Prepare Script</a>
section for an example of how to register a STAF command via the CronUI. 
<p>
Refer to the <a href="#Header_References">"References"</a> section for
where to get more information about Jython and Python.

If you are already a CPython programmer, or are hoping to use CPython
code under Jython, refer to the <a href="#Header_CPythonDiffs">

differences in the two implementations of Python.

<hr>
<h1><a name="Header_CronVariables" href="#ToC_CronVariables">Cron Python Variables</a></h1>

The following variables are set in Python by the Cron service when a registration
is triggered.  These Python variables can be referenced by Python code in the
PREPARE, PYTHONREQUEST, PYTHONMACHINE, and PYTHONSERVICE options for the REGISTER
request and in the SCRIPT option for the TRIGGER request.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>STAFCronID</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Description:  The ID of the Cron registration being triggered</li>
        <li>Assigned:  When a registration is triggered</li>

        <li>Assigned:  When a registration is triggered, the Cron service
            sets it to 'true' by default, but you can override its value
            if desired by setting it to any other string value in the
            PREPARE option on a REGISTER request</li>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;
<hr>

<h1><b><a name="Header_CronUI" href="#ToC_CronUI">Cron User Interface (CronUI)</a></b></h1>

<p>The Cron service provides a User Interface (CronUI) to simplify interaction with
the Cron service.  The CronUI is especially useful when registering complex STAF
commands with Python code because it helps avoid some issues that you
have when registering via the command line by reducing the need for escaping
quotes and allows you to easily enter multiple lines of Python code via
a text box for the PREPARE option,
The CronUI also allows you to modify existing registrations (without having to unregister
and the re-register the updated STAF command), and view the Cron service's log.
<p>Note that when viewing the Cron service's log, the Cron User Inteface
utilizes the STAFLogViewer class to display the logs.  For more information on
how to use the STAFLogViewer, refer to section "3.11 Class STAFLogViewer" of the
STAF Java User's Guide (<a href="http://staf.sourceforge.net/current/STAFJava.htm">
http://staf.sourceforge.net/current/STAFJava.htm</a>).

<h2><a name="Header_UIUsing" href="#ToC_UIUsing">Using the CronUI</a></h2>

To use the Cron User Interface, after installing and configuring the Cron Service, from
a command prompt enter one of the following commands:
<ul>
<li>
<p><tt>java -jar STAFCron.jar</tt>
<p>If the STAFCron.jar file is not in the current directory where you
are executing this command, then you will need to specify the full path (or
the path relative to the current directory) to the STAFCron.jar file.
<p>Note that to run this command, the STAFCron.jar file does not need
to be included in your CLASSPATH.
</li>
<li>
<p><tt>java com.ibm.staf.service.cron.CronUI</tt>
<p>Note that to run this command, the STAFCron.jar file must be
included in your CLASSPATH.
</li>
</ul>
<p>A User Interface will be displayed which allows you to interact with
the Cron service.
<br><br>
<img src="cron1.gif" alt="CronUI">
<br>
<p>The main CronUI window displays a table of all of the currently registered
STAF commands.  The screen capture above shows what the table would look like
if there are no registrations.  The window is comprised of the following
components (from to to bottom):
<ol>
<li>Menu bar
<li>Service configuration options
<li>Registration table
<li>Status bar
</ol>

<h4>Menu bar</h4>
<p>The File menu bar contains the following menu items:
<ul>
<li><b>New Registration...</b> - This opens a new registration dialog where you can
input information about a new STAF command you wish to register.
<br><br>
<li><b>Exit</b> - This exits the CronUI application.
</ul>
<p>The View menu bar contains the following menu items:
<ul>
<li><b>Refresh</b> - This refreshes the registration table by querying the
specified Cron service name on the specified machine name.
<br><br>
<li><b>Service Log for ID...</b> - This allows you to query the service log
records for a particular ID.  A dialog will be displayed where you can enter the
ID.  It will generate a QUERY request with the option CONTAINS
<tt>[ID=&lt;xx>]</tt> where <tt>&lt;xx></tt> is the ID you specified.
<br><br>
<li><b>Service Log last 100 recrods</b> - This allows you to query the last
100 records of the service log.
<br><br>
<li><b>Service Log for submitted STAF comamnds...</b> - This allows you to
query the service log records for a particular submitted STAF command.  A new
dialog will open that shows you a list of the submitted STAF commands in the
service log.  The most recent entries in the service log will be at the top
of the list, and the oldest entries in the service log will be at the bottom
of the list.  The list entries will be in the format 
<tt>[ID=&lt;xx>] [&lt;machine>:&lt;requestNumber>] &lt;Submitted STAF command></tt>
where <tt>&lt;xx></tt> is the ID for which the STAF command was submitted,
<tt>&lt;machine></tt> is the machine where the STAF command was submitted,
<tt>&lt;requestNumber></tt> is the request number for the submitted STAF
command, and <tt>&lt;Submitted STAF command></tt> is the actual STAF command
that was submitted (this is the STAF command after all Python code has been
evaluated).  Select the entry in the list for which you wish to view the log
records, and a QUERY request will be generated with the option CONTAINS
<tt>[ID=&lt;xx>] [&lt;machine>:&lt;requestNumber>]</tt> where <tt>&lt;xx></tt>
is the ID for which the STAF command was submitted,
<tt>&lt;machine></tt> is the machine where the STAF command was submitted, and
<tt>&lt;requestNumber></tt> is the request number for the submitted STAF
command.
<br><br>
<li><b>Entire Service Log</b> - This allows you to query the entire service log.
<br><br>
<li><b>Delete Service Log</b> - This allows you to delete the service log.  A
confirmation popup will be displayed.
</ul>

<p>The Selected menu bar will only be enabled if there is a row currently
selected in the registration table, and contains the following menu items:
<ul>
<li><b>Edit</b> - This allows you edit the data for the selected ID.  A new
dialog will be displayed, similar to the dialog displayed when you click on
"New Registration..." in the File menu bar, except the fields will be filled
in with the data for the selected ID.
<br><br>
<li><b>Enable</b> - This allows you enable the selected ID.  This option will
only be available if the selected ID is currently disabled.
<br><br>
<li><b>Disable</b> - This allows you disable the selected ID.  This option will
only be available if the selected ID is currently enabled.
<br><br>
<li><b>Trigger</b> - This allows you trigger the STAF command for the
selected ID.  This is useful when testing your registered STAF commands (where
you don't want to wait for any of the time triggers to match).  Any Python code
in the registration will be evaluated, and the STAF command will be submitted.
After the STAF command has been submitted, the service log will be queried
with the option CONTAINS
<tt>[ID=&lt;xx>] [&lt;machine>:&lt;requestNumber>]</tt> where <tt>&lt;xx></tt>
is the ID for which the STAF command was submitted,
<tt>&lt;machine></tt> is the machine where the STAF command was submitted, and
<tt>&lt;requestNumber></tt> is the request number for the submitted STAF
command.  In the log viewer, you can click on "Refresh" in the View menu bar
to refresh the log entries and determine if the STAF command has completed.
Note that if the submitted STAF command was registered with the ONCE option,
triggering the STAF command will not cause the registration to be unregistered.
<br>
<li><b>Trigger with script...</b> - This is similar to the <b>Trigger</b>
menu item, except prior to submitting the command, a dialog will be displayed
where you can enter any Python code that you want to have executed by the
Python interpreter, prior to the evaluation of any PREPARE, PYTHONMACHINE,
PYTHONSERVICE, or PYTHONREQUEST options.  This is useful if you need to
simluate the setting of any variables that might be needed for these options.
<br><br>
<li><b>Copy to new registration</b> - This allows to you copy the registration
data for an existing registration to a new registration.  A new dialog will be
presented with all of the data from the selected registration.  You can change
any of the data as needed, and then click on the "Register" button and a new
ID will be registered.
<br><br>
<li><b>Unregister</b> - This allows you to unregister the selected registration.
A confirmation popup will be displayed.
</ul>

<p>Note that all of the "Selected" menu items are also available in a pop-up menu
when you right click on a row in the registration table, and they perform the
exact same functions as the "Selected" menu bar items.

<p>The Help menu bar contains the following menu items:
<ul>
<li><b>About</b> - This displays the version of the Cron service.
</ul>

<h4>Service configuration options</h4>
<p>The "Service Machine" text field allows you to specify the hostname of the
machine where the Cron service is running.  The default is "local".
<p>The "Service Name" text field allows you to specify the service name for which
the Cron service was configured.  The default is "Cron".
<p>After changing either
of these values, you can press the "Enter" key to refresh the table, or click
on "View" in the menu bar, and then select "Refresh".
<p>

<h4>Registration table</h4>
<p>The registration table displays the current registrations for the Cron
service you specified in the service configuration fields (for Service Machine and
Service Name).  It is refreshed every time you click on "View" in the menu bar
and selecte "Refresh", as well as when you change the Service Machine or Service Name
fields and press "Enter".
<p>It is also refreshed whenever you add a new registration, unregister a
registration, edit a registration, or copy an existing registration to a new
registration.
<p>The registration table has the following columns:
<ul>
<li><b>ID</b> - This is the registration ID.
<li><b>Description</b> - This is the registration's description.
<li><b>Machine</b> - This is the registration's machine.  Note that it may
contain Python code.
<li><b>Service</b> - This is the registration's service.  Note that it may
contain Python code.
<li><b>Request</b> - This is the registration's request.  Note that it may
contain Python code.
</ul>

<h4>Status bar</h4>
<p>The status bar shows informational messages.  Here are the possible
messages:
<ul>
<li><b>Double click on an existing registration to edit</b> - Displayed when
there is at least one registration in the table.
<li><b>Click on File -> New Registration... in the menu bar to register a
new STAF command</b> - Displayed when there are currently no registrations in
the table.
<li><b>Enter a valid Service Machine and Service Name</b> - Displayed if the
machine entered in the "Service Machine" text field cannot be reached, or if
the service name entered in the "Service Name" text field is not a valid
service name on the machine.
</ul>

<h2><a name="Header_UINewReg" href="#ToC_UINewReg">Submit a New Registration</a></h2>

<p>To submit a new registration, click on "File" in the menu bar and then
select "New Registration...".  You will see the following window:
<br><br>
<img src="cron2.gif" alt="CronUI">
<p>This window allows you to specify the data for the registration:
<ul>
<li><b>Registration ID</b> - The registration ID.  Since this is a new
registration, the value is "N/A".
<li><b>Description</b> - The description of the registration.  This field is
optional.
<li><b>Target Machine</b> - The machine where you wish to have the STAF
command executed.  This field is required.  If the text contains Python code,
then select "Python" next to the "Target Machine" label.
<li><b>Target Service</b> - The service for the STAF command you wish to have executed.
This field is required.  If the text contains Python code, then select

<li><b>Minute</b> - Specifies the exact minute(s) that the STAF command executes.
The valid values are 0 - 59.  You can specify either * (an asterisk) or ANY,
meaning all valid values, or a list of elements separated by commas.  An
element is either a number or an inclusive range, indicated by two numbers
separated by a minus sign (such as 1-15).
<li><b>Hour</b> - Specifies the exact hour(s) that the STAF command executes.
The valid values are 0 - 23.  You can specify either * (an asterisk) or ANY,
meaning all valid values, or a list of elements separated by commas.  An element
is either a number or an inclusive range, indicated by two numbers separated by
a minus sign (such as 8-17).
<li><b>Day</b> - Specifies the exact day(s) that the STAF command executes.  The
valid values are 1 - 31.  You can specify either * (an asterisk) or ANY, meaning
all valid values, or a list of elements separated by commas.  An element is
either a number or an inclusive range, indicated by two numbers separated by a

<li><b>Month</b> - Specifies the exact month(s) that the STAF command executes.
The valid values are 1 - 12.  You can specify either * (an asterisk) or ANY,
meaning all valid values, or a list of elements separated by commas.  An element
is either a number or an inclusive range, indicated by two numbers separated by
a minus sign (such as 5-6).
<li><b>Weekday</b> - Specifies the exact weekday(s) that the STAF command executes.
The valid values are 0 - 6  (Sunday = 0, ....).  You can also specify the
textual weekday ("Sunday", etc.).  You can specify either * (an asterisk) or
ANY, meaning all valid values, or a list of elements separated by commas.  An
element is either a number or an inclusive range, indicated by two numbers
separated by a minus sign (such as 1-5).
<li><b>Once</b> - Indicates that the STAF command should only be executed one
time. After the specified time interval has occurred and the STAF command has
been submitted, the ID for this request will be unregistered.
<li><b>Enabled</b> - Indicates that the STAF command will be enabled when it
is registered. If the STAF command is disabled, it will not be submitted
when its time triggers occur.
</ul>
<p>Note that at least one of the time interval options (Minute, Hour, Day,
Month, Weekday) must be specified.
<p>To get help on any of these options while using CronUI, mover the cursor
over the text field or checkbox and a tool tip will be displayed.
<p>Fill in the appropriate information for the STAF command you wish to have
executed.  For example, to have a STAX job executed at 1:00AM every day:
<br><br>
<img src="cron3.gif" alt="CronUI">
<p>Click on the "Register" button and you will see that the STAF command has
been assigned a unique registration ID, and that it is listed in the
registration table.

<h2><a name="Header_UIRegExample" href="#ToC_UIRegExample">
Registration Example using Python and Prepare Script</a></h2>

<p>To register a more complex STAF command, you may find it easier to
use the CronUI instead of submitting a <tt>REGISTER</tt> request to
the Cron service via the command line.  This is especially true for
STAF commands that use Python.  Also, if you select to specify the
request using Python and use the "Prepare Script" field, you usually don't
have to escape as many quotes.
<p>
This section shows an example of registering a more complex STAF command
using the CronUI.  It will use the same example that was discussed
in the <a href="#Header_Register">REGISTER</a> section that registered
a STAF command via the command line to execute STAX job /tests/TestA.xml
via the STAX service on machine server1 every day at midnight and passed
the following argument map to the STAX job:
<tt>{'machine': 'client1', 'testDir': '/tests'}</tt>
<p>
Remember that a STAF variable reference is denoted by surrounding the
variable in curly braces, e.g. {MyVar}.  So, since the request contains
a "{" which is not being used to denote a STAF variable reference, this
example selects "Python" for the target request so that STAF variable resolution
will not be performed.  If "Python" was not selected for the target
request, then the "{" would need to be escaped with a caret, "^", so that
no STAF variable resolution would be performed.
This example also uses the "Prepare Script" field to construct
the STAX EXECUTE request using Python.
<p>
The following is an example of how you could register the following STAX EXECUTE
command to run every day at midnight:
<p>
<tt>STAF server1 STAX EXECUTE FILE "/tests/TestA.xml"
ARGS "{'machine': 'client1', 'testDir': '/tests'}"</tt>

<p>Suppose we want to test the STAF command that we just registered, and we
don't want to wait until the next time the month changes.  To do this,
click on "Selected" in the menu bar and select "Trigger", or
right-click on its row in the registration table, and select
"Trigger" in the popup menu.
<p>The STAF command will be submitted and a STAFLogViewer window will open to
display the service log entries for that STAF command:

<p>In this case, since the process returned the version immediately, the
log query shows that the process has completed, and includes the information it
returned.

<h1><a name="Header_CPythonDiffs" href="#ToC_CPythonDiffs">
Appendix B: Jython and CPython Differences</a></h1>

Although in most cases Jython behavior is identical to the C-language
implementation of Python (CPython), there are still cases where the
two implementations differ.  If you are already a CPython programmer,
or are hoping to use CPython code under Jython, you need to be aware
of these differences.  Also, there is a time lag between a new CPython
release and the corresponding Jython release.  The Cron service uses
Jython 2.5.2 which implements the same set of language features as CPython 2.5.
Jython 2.5.2 cannot execute Python code that uses functions that were
provided in later versions of Python, such as Python 2.6.
<p>
Most Python modules that are written in Python work fine in Jython.
A few types of modules will not run under Jython such as:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Modules that contain functionality not included in a JVM
    <p>
    Some standard CPython modules depend on operating system calls
    that are not available under Java.  The most notable of these
    is <i>os</i>, which actually does run in Jython, but is missing
    much of its functionality.
<p>
<li>Modules that are implemented in C
    <p>
    A number of common CPython modules are implemented in C rather
    than Python, either for a speed boost or because the module is
    a C wrapper around an external C library.  The C modules, or
    any modules that depend on them, will not run in Jython.
</ul>
<p>
See the "Jython Essentials" book, written by Samuele Pedroni and
Noel Rappin, for more information about the differences between
Jython and CPython.
