<b>STAF V2 customers -- Time to move ahead!</b> 
<p>
End of service for all STAF V2 releases is planned for April 21, 2006.
We encourage you to move to STAF V3 now!
As of April 21, 2006, we will no longer fix bugs in STAF V2 and will not
release any new versions of STAF V2 (though we will continue to try to
answer STAF V2 questions).

<p>
This education package is intended to familiarize new users with the STAF and STAX tools, and to provide on-hands experience with the tools. 
<p>
Each file contains a "staf" and "stax" directory.  Each of these directories contains a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation (STAFHandson.ppt and STAXHandson.ppt) for the lecture portion of the education.  Note that each of the directories also contains an HTML version of the presentations (STAFHandson.htm and STAXHandson.htm).  There are also 2 files (STAFAgenda.html and STAXAgenda.html) which  describe the agenda for the education, including the schedule for the exercises.  The exercises are located in the "staf/exercises" and "stax/exercises" directories.
