<center><h1>Get Involved with STAF</h1></center>
<p>
If you enjoy using STAF, please consider joining our development team to
assist in improving and extending STAF. Open source projects depend on people like you to keep them
going, so your help is needed!  
Send a note to the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/staf-devel">staf-devel</a> mailing list
to request to join the STAF development team.
<p>
The <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/staf-devel">staf-devel</a> mailing
list is the forum for all sorts of STAF developer discussions.  To find out what features
and fixes are under consideration, check out 
the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=33142&atid=407381">bug reports</a> 
and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=407384&group_id=33142&func=browse" class="sidebar">feature requests</a>
on the SourceForge project page.  Even if you
don't have a SourceForge account, you can add to our collection of good 
ideas by submitting your own.
<p>
If you have a service you want to add that you think others
will have a use for as well, we can always use help in extending the STAF services.
Or, if your favorite operating system is not supported, you might want to port STAF
to your platform.
<p>
With anonymous CVS access (available to everyone), you can
make changes to the STAF source code and submit patches on SourceForge that allow other
people to try out your improvements.
