COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS
========================

Prerequisites:
--------------

* Perl 5.8.0 or higher
* STAF 2.4.0.1 or higher

To build:
---------

Step 1 is to create the Makefile for the build, using something like:

perl Makefile.PL INC=-I/usr/local/staf/include/ \
LIBS="-L/usr/local/staf/lib -lSTAF"

Change both instances of "/usr/local/staf" above to the location to
which staf was installed.  A plain:

perl Makefile.PL

Should work if you installed STAF in the default location of 
/usr/local/staf, or in the FHS recommended place -- /opt/staf.

Next, run `make'.

You should now run the test suite to ensure that your build was
successful.  To run the tests, you will need to have a STAF daemon running
locally (STAFProc).  Just run `make test'.  If the results are not a 100%
pass, then check the following:

If all tests fail then you've not got your libraries set up right,
fix them.

If all tests in `basic' pass, but the others fail most of their tests,
there is a problem with your STAF installation, or you're not running
STAFProc.

If an odd few fail but the majority pass, we need to know about it,
so please run `make test TEST_VERBOSE=1' and copy _all_ of the output
of make test into a file and attach it to a bug report on:

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=33142&atid=407381

To install:
-----------

Don't install it unless the tests pass.

If they do, then just running `make install' will install PLSTAF to the
standard location for Perl modules st your site.

If you don't want them in the standard place you need to read `perldoc
ExtUtils::MakeMaker'
