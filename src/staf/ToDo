- Update docs for info on STAFCODEPAGEOVERRIDE and updating alias.txt
- Make SIGTERM and SIGINT do a SHUTDOWN SHUTDOWN
- Add option to VAR LIST to list ONLY variables in the handle pool
- Add info on which interfaces are enabled
- Add an ICONTAINS (case-insensitive contains) option to the QUEUE (and maybe
  LOG) service(s)
- Enhance command parser to allow you to specify more contraints on
  option values (enumerated types, numeric, etc.).  Also allow it to
  resolve variables by letting you pass in a STAFHandle_t.  You should also
  be allow to state whether certain options have string resolved or not.
- Fix "inline" stuff on win32.  Moving all methods which return STAFRefPtr's
  may fix the heap-management issues
- Return stack trace when a Java exception is thrown
- Add a MACHINE option to var resolve so that services don't have to check
  where requests came from
- Think about stripping whitespace from around service/machine names to
  avoid silly user errors like "queue "
- Fix reference to FmtLog.cmd in User's Guide
- Fix problem with non-existent remote system requests when using MACHINE
  statement in STAF.cfg
- Investigate using realpath() on unix systems instead of requiring STAFProc
  be in the PATH
- Update Unix install docs to talk about how to autostart STAF on boot
- Fix ResPool bug where timed-out request still shows as pending
- Fix problem where not having staf/lib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH causes an
  exception instead of reporting that the library can't be found
- Fix bug with 'staf local process start command notepad parms "1 "' (this
  may require some fixes in other STAF services)
- Fix bug where getpid() and getpidSTAF() return different things for
  STAFProc.  Should probably move getpidSTAF() to STAFUtilCommon.cpp and make
  STAFProc call it instead of getpid().
- Fix STAFHandle.java to include a constructor that accepts the handle.  This
  will allow static handles to be used in Java programs.
- Fix bug where file which is used in PROCESS START STDOUT can't be accessed
  until STAFProc is stopped (may be windows only)
